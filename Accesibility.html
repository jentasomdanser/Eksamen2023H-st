What is The Viewport?

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.

        <!-- <p> Write here raport on our choices related to accesibility. 
        
        Top navigation bar choices were made based on most of our references of working websites. It makes the usability more intuitive since 
        most users are already used to this set up. We followed the heriatic laws of UX design with this option. Making 
        this design eliminate the need to search or learn a new usability flow. 
        We also made the nav bar reactive to size, to enhance accesibility of our menu bar when the screen is in phone size. This means 
        that when the page is resized with css code of media@ the content gets adjusted to new properties defined in that css. In our case 
        it means we have a hamburger menu, that unfolds when clicking on top nav bar. This makes our accesibility adaptable 
        to several screen sizes.
