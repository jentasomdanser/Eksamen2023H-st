What is The Viewport?

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.

Short presentation of accessibility for your site. Test your site with an automated test. Write a very short text 
(about 400-500 words) about how you tested the code for accessibility using this automated test. Tell us how you

        <!-- <p> Write here raport on our choices related to accesibility. -->



        <p> In this page we demonstrate the acceisibility and one of our most significant choices to create safe accesibility for all type of screen sizes. </p>
        
        <p> We chose to merge the nav bar into a hamburger menu under 1100px width screen size. Top navigation bar choices were made based on 
        most of our references of working websites. It makes the usability more intuitive since 
        most users are already used to this set up. We followed the heriatic laws of UX design with this option. Making 
        this design eliminate the need to search or learn a new usability flow. 
        By mading the nav bar reactive to size, we enhance accesibility of our menu bar when the screen is in phone size. This means 
        that when the page is resized with css code of media@ the content gets adjusted to new properties defined in that css. In our case 
        it means we have a hamburger menu, that unfolds when clicking on top nav bar. This makes our accesibility adaptable 
        to several screen sizes. </p>

        <p> You can see that this allready gave us a good accesibility score on our first test. See picture underneath: </p>

        <img srcset="image\indexPageFirstTest.png" alt="Accisibility Index, page first try">

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p> We then added a new meta tag to fullfill the CEO requirements of having a description text of what the page contains. Demostrated on next picture is the meta tagg with description: </p>

        <img srcset="image/codeScreenshotMeta.png" alt="Screenshot of the code in Index page we changed to increase our accesibility score on CEO">

        <p> This made our score get even better as you can see on the next picture: </p>
