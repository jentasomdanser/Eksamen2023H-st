What is The Viewport?

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. 

To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.

    <h1>Driving Sustainable Change through Technology: A Path to Achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In today's rapidly evolving world, the intersection of sustainability and technology has become pivotal in 
    our quest to address global challenges. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
    provide a universal call to action, aiming to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. 
    Technology, with its transformative potential, is a powerful tool in achieving these goals. 
    In this article, we explore the ways in which technology is driving sustainability and making an impact on the UN SDGs.

<h2>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – A Global Framework</h2>

<p>The UN SDGs serve as a global roadmap for addressing pressing environmental, social, and economic issues. There are 17 goals in total, ranging from no poverty and zero hunger to climate action and affordable and clean energy. Let's delve into how technology plays a role in advancing these goals.</p>
