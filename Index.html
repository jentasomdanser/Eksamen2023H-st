<!--her skal vi ha om OsloMet Campus. */
Theme: OsloMet Campus in general or Pilestredet 35 in particular
index.html should have a general introduction with at least one relevant image
One page must be "Accessibility" — see below
One page must be "Topical" — see below
The remaining (1 or 2) pages should have images and headings presenting a place or an aspect of the campus/ 
building, e.g. a canteen; the text may be "dummy text" — see below
All pages but one must share the same visual design
You may choose which (if any) one page should have a different design
Comment your code
Any semantic element deserves a super-short comment on what it is
Any CSS selector (in the CSS, not when used in HTML) deserves a comment, at least a descriptor
Any code that is used in scaling or responsive to screen-size deserves a comment
The main purpose for the comments should be to help a future developer take over your project 
and develop it further; for me, it helps weed out the most obvious copied-code-without-understanding issues -->
