# Eksamen2023H-st
Dette er vår hjemme eksamen til Data 1200. Når vi har sittet sammen har vi jobbet på en pc så det ser ut som en har gjort mer arbeid enn de andre, men alle har jobbet like mye. Vi har også brukt demoktrati innenfor design og konsepter som blir brukt i oppgaven.

Oppgave teksten

Create a website with 4 or 5 pages
Theme: OsloMet Campus in general or Pilestredet 35 in particular
index.html should have a general introduction with at least one relevant image
One page must be "Accessibility" — see below
One page must be "Topical" — see below
The remaining (1 or 2) pages should have images and headings presenting a place or an aspect of the campus/ building, e.g. a canteen; the text may be "dummy text" — see below
All pages but one must share the same visual design
You may choose which (if any) one page should have a different design
Comment your code
Any semantic element deserves a super-short comment on what it is
Any CSS selector (in the CSS, not when used in HTML) deserves a comment, at least a descriptor
Any code that is used in scaling or responsive to screen-size deserves a comment
The main purpose for the comments should be to help a future developer take over your project and develop it further; for me, it helps weed out the most obvious copied-code-without-understanding issues
Compulsory pages in site:
Accessibility-page
Short presentation of accessibility for your site. Test your site with an automated test. Write a very short text (about 400-500 words) about how you tested the code for accessibility using this automated test. Tell us how you checked, and coding choices you made for universal design beyond what an automated test could tell you. You are recommended to use screenshots from the testing site and of your code – lack of images may affect your score.

Topical-page
Copy a short text (anywhere from 300 to 1000 words) from DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers or other subject you have completed. (Or write a new, short text.)

Add images (if there are none). Remember that in Norwegian copyright law, photographer must always be included. (May be organisation, e.g."Photo: Scanpix", can be in the code, hence invisible on the page itself.)

Add headings (if there are none).

Add links (if there are none). This text should have multiple links to external sites with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to.

If you wish to show off some skills, but found that difficult with the other pages, you can make this (or another) page different from the others, with a distinct visual of functional identity.

Dummy texts
Apart from the pages "Accessibility" and "Topical", you may use a Lorem-ipsum text. We shall not read the other texts, but we shall look for relevant and correct use of headings, links and <picture>/ <img> with alt-text. This is often easier to do correctly with actual texts than dummy-text. Even in a dummy-text, you should use real headings, like <h1>Study areas in P35</h1>…<h2>The library</h2>.
