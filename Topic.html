<!-- Topical-page
Copy a short text (anywhere from 300 to 1000 words) from DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers 
or other subject you have completed. 
(Or write a new, short text.)

Add images (if there are none). Remember that in Norwegian copyright law, photographer must always be included. 
(May be organisation, e.g."Photo: Scanpix", can be in the code, hence invisible on the page itself.)

Add headings (if there are none).

Add links (if there are none). This text should have multiple links to external sites with relevant information. 
We shall not grade you on how relevant the information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect 
it to be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to.

If you wish to show off some skills, but found that difficult with the other pages, you can make this (or another) 
page different from the others, with a distinct visual of functional identity. -->
