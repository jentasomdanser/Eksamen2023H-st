What is The Viewport?

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.

            <h2> Innovation camp Group</h2>
            <p> In the bustling setting of university, the paths of three unlikely friends crossed during the Innovation camp's
                initial grouping of eight students. Emma, a creative multitalented artist with a flair for oposites that meet in cuteness; 
                Håvard, a music composer, introvert immersed in code and tech instruments to create soundscapes; and Yasmin, a balance seeker
                adventurer with a deep relationship to creativity, formed a trinity that defied the odds. 
                Their quirks and eccentricities, far from driving them apart, acted as a magnetic force that brought them closer, 
                turning their differences into their greatest strengths.
                
                Through the first semester, this unique trio delved into the world of web development. 
                Their collaboration was nothing short of extraordinary, combining creativity, technical excellence, 
                and boundless enthusiasm to create projects that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing. 
                Their journey served as a heartwarming example of the power of diversity and unity, illustrating that, 
                in the vibrant landscape of university life, even the quirkiest individuals can find common ground, 
                turning their weirdness into a source of strength and building a remarkable story of friendship and success.</p>
