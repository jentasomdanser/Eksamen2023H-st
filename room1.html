What is The Viewport?

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages 
to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large 
to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.

        <h1>Dragons Enroll in Oslo Metropolitan University's "Fire Breathing 101" Course</h1>

        <div class="text-boxes">
        
        
        <p>Oslo, October 24, 2023 - In an astonishing turn of events, dragons have been spotted soaring over 
        Oslo Metropolitan University (OMU) campus, and they're not here to terrorize the city. Instead, they've enrolled in OMU's prestigious "Fire Breathing 101" course.</p>

        <p>The news of these mythical creatures attending the university has taken the world by storm, with experts and 
        enthusiasts flocking to Oslo to witness the spectacle.</p>

        <p>Professor Elira Moonshadow, the renowned dragonologist leading the course, is thrilled by this unprecedented 
            enrollment. She said, 
        
            "Dragons are magnificent beings with an untapped potential for contributing to our world. 
        
            By teaching them to control their fire-breathing abilities responsibly, we hope to foster a new era of 
            cooperation between humans and dragons."</p>


        <p>Local businesses have also jumped on the dragon bandwagon, offering dragon-friendly services, such as tailoring 
            extra-large textbooks, 
        
            designing customized flight suits for dragon-sized students, and hosting exclusive "Dragon Diners" for these 
            new scholars.</p>

        <p>Dragons aren't the only fantastical creatures making their mark at OMU. 
        
            Rumor has it that a group of friendly giants is considering enrolling in the "Civil Engineering for Giants" 
            program, 
        
            while a curious centaur has been spotted exploring the university's sprawling campus.</p>

        <p>As the world watches in amazement, Oslo Metropolitan University is proving that when it comes to education, even 
            the most extraordinary students are welcome.</p>

        <p>In the coming months, OMU is planning to launch a unique study abroad program, inviting students from Elven 
            kingdoms, 
        
            Dwarf strongholds, and merfolk cities to join the academic community in Oslo.</p>

        <p>So, keep your eyes on the skies and your textbooks close; who knows what magical beings will be spotted at 
        OMU next?</p>
